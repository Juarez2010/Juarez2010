### Hello.
### I'm Juarez2010. Some of you may know me from a popular coding website called Scratch.
###
### You can visit my Scratch profile at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Juarez2010/
###
### While you are here, you can look at anything I have made on Github. I'm mostly active on here.
###
### I’m currently working on making an ELA section for my website. 
###
### Here are some ways you can reach me: 1. Go to my Scratch profile and leave a comment there.
### Another way you can reach me is by creating a new issue on one of my repositories (make sure it's not the Cookie Clicker one, I won't respond there.) and leaving your question there.
###
### If you need help with anything CSS and HTML related, you can ask me.
